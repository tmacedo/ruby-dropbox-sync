= A Dropbox Sync Daemon / cron script written in Ruby.

It allows you to sync a folder in your Dropbox with a directory in your filesystem without running the Dropbox client (useful in non-x86 NAS, etc).

== Key issues

Dropbox is unwilling to approve a "production" key for this application due to the keys being embedded in the source. Therefore only 5 different Dropbox users will be able to use this application as is. If you run into issues with the key you should create a new app ( https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps ) and replace the keys in lib/initializer.rb

== Usage

The first step is to install the bundle:

  bundle install

Then you need to allow acess to your Dropbox and select a local directory for sync:

  bundle exec ruby oauth.rb

Once that is done you should be able to sync:

  bundle exec ruby cron.rb

The daemon can be started like this:

  bundle exec ruby daemon_runner.rb start

== Notes

* Remote *always wins*. That means that if a file is changed in both Dropbox and locally, the local version is overwritten.
* You can at any moment reset your sync by removing the mappings.db file.

= TODO

* Tests
* Conflict resolution rules
* Proper handling of directory tree modification times
